bio: "I'm a 22 year old dude from Trondheim. I'm currently studying Interaction Design at NTNU in Gjøvik. I've always loved making stuff, especially if it looks cool. When I'm not in class, you can find me tinkering with cars and bikes or hanging out with my friends, playing some video games."

project_desc_1: "As part of my education at NTNU, i got the opportunity to spend 270 work hours as an intern at a company of choice. I applied to Visma Skøyen and got a spot. The project I became part of was called Scanner Multi Page, and was an improvement project of an already existing app for scanning invoices and travel bills. The main goal of the project was to develop a function to be able to scan several invoices in the same process.
