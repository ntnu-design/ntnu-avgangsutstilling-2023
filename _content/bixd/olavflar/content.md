bio: "Hold on to your hats, folks, because you’re about to meet a true creative force. I’m Olav Friisberg Larssen, a 32-year-old sonic wizard and UX design mastermind, and I’m here to take you on a wild ride through the world of sound production and digital design.
I’ve lived my life on the cutting edge of creativity, pushing boundaries and blowing minds as a sound engineer for some of the most electrifying films, live shows, and DJ gigs around. I’ve crafted soundscapes that transport listeners to another world, capturing their hearts and igniting their imaginations with every beat and every blast of sound.

But my adventures don’t stop there. I’m currently living the dream as a UX Designer at Digitaliseringsdirektoratet, where I’m using my powers for good to make the digital world a better place. I’m working on the front lines, creating recruitment videos and improving internal websites and recruitment sites to ensure that every user has a seamless, intuitive, and enjoyable experience.

I’m a student at NTNU, where I’m honing my skills in Interaction Design and learning how to use technology to create solutions that make a real difference in the world.

So what’s next for me? I’m ready for anything. I’m on the hunt for cool projects and amazing people to work with. And when I’m not working, you’ll find me spending time with my loving family, recharging my batteries and getting ready for the next big adventure.
So, buckle up and get ready to join me on a wild ride through the world of sound and design. I promise you won’t be disappointed."
