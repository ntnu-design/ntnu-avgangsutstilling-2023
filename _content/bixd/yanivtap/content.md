bio: "Hei, my name is Yaniv-Tamer Pries, I am designer who focuses on human-machine interaction and information architecture. Oh, and i’ve been dabbling with graphic and motion design since 2017.

Part German and part Filipino, raised in both the Philippines and Norway, my roots stem from a family that has always worked with something technical. My late father introduced me to computers and its hardware when i was younger. I was fascinated by how it worked, especially with interfaces such as the humble keyboard and mouse."
